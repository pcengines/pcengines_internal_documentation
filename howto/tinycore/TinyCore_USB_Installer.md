TinyCore

TinyCore is a tiny Linux distribution.
Our [TinyCore USB installer](http://pcengines.ch/file/apu-bootable-usb-installer_v1.8.exe) is a Windows tool to prepare an USB stick ready for booting on an apu board.

An USB stick prepared with TinyCore contains a file `autostart.sh` in the root folder. This file can be customized for many different tasks.

TinyCore can be used to automatically flash a certain BIOS version, automatically flash a compressed disk image to the installed mSATA, etc.
